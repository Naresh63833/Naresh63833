Hello, I'm Naresh P, a passionate Software developer currently refining my skills in Software development. My dedication to continuous learning is fueled by a desire to stay at the forefront of technology.

During my final year, I successfully completed a challenging E-commerce project using Android, Java, and Firebase. Over six months, I navigated the complexities of creating a seamless digital shopping experience, honing my problem-solving abilities and project management skills.

I furthered my skills by independently studying Java via online resources like YouTube. I also designed a portfolio website using HTML and CSS, showcasing my projects creatively and technically.

In a subsequent project, I delved into the development of an Airline Reservation System using C# for Windows applications with SQL Server. This experience allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in creating complex systems and integrating databases.

Now actively seeking full-time opportunities, I aim to leverage my academic background, self-driven learning, and project experiences to contribute effectively to a dynamic development team.
